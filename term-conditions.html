Salasar Algo acts only as a website / software / platform / portal service provider according to clients / your needs. Accordingly, clients / investors should not act on any information in this document without obtaining specific advice from their financial advisors and should not rely on information herein as the basis for their investment decisions. Futures trading and algorithmic trading involves a substantial risk of loss and is not appropriate for everyone. No representation is being made that utilizing the algorithmic trading strategy will result in profitable trading or be free of risk of loss. Before deciding to trade or invest you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and ability to tolerate risk. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment. Only risk capital should be used.</p>

                      <h4>Accuracy Of Information</h4>

Salasar Algo has taken reasonable measures to ensure the accuracy of the information contained herein; however, Salasar Algo does not guarantee its accuracy, and is not liable for any loss or damage which may arise directly or indirectly from such content or from an inability to access such information, for any delay in or failure of the transmission or receipt of any instruction or notification in connection therewith. By using this website / software / platform / portal, you acknowledge that any recommendations or trading analysis found herein are provided for educational and illustrative purposes only and should not be used in connection with the formation or execution of any trading decisions. Futures trading and algorithmic trading involve a substantial risk of loss and you should never make a decision based solely on the information found on this website / software / platform / portal.

                      <h4>Market Research, Reports, And Educational Materials</h4>
                      <p class="mt-15">Any opinions, news, research, analyses, prices, reports, graphs, charts, or other information contained herein is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice or recommendations. Salasar Algo is not liable for any loss or damage, including without limitation, any loss of profit, which may arise directly or indirectly from the use of or reliance on any such information.

                      <h4>Distribution</h4>
                      <p class="mt-15">This information is not intended for distribution, or use by, any person in any country where such distribution or use would be contrary to local law or regulation. None of the services or information referred to herein are available to persons residing in any country where the provision of such services or information would be contrary to local law or regulation. It is the responsibility of users of this information to ascertain the terms of and comply with any local law or regulation to which they are subject.</p>

                      <h4>Performance Results</h4>
                      <p class="mt-15">Past performance results are shown for illustration and example only, are hypothetical and as such have many inherent limitations. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. In fact, there are frequently significant differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading technique or methodology. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. For example, the ability to withstand losses or adhere to a particular trading program despite trading losses are material factors which can adversely affect actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.</p>

                      <h4>No Warranty/Gurantee</h4>
